    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Configuration (`logging.basicConfig`)\n",
    "\n",
    "This function configures the **root logger**. It defines *how* and *where* your messages will appear.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`filename=\"app.log\"`**: Tells Python to save the logs into a file named `app.log`. If this isn't set, the logs will just print to your console (terminal).\n",
    "* **`filemode=\"w\"`**: Standing for \"Write,\" this means every time you run the script, the old log file is deleted and a new one starts. If you change this to `\"a\"` (Append), the logs will keep growing without deleting previous entries.\n",
    "* **`level=logging.DEBUG`**: This sets the **threshold**. Logging has a hierarchy of importance (see below). By setting it to `DEBUG`, you are telling the logger to capture **everything** from the lowest level up.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Understanding the Format\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`format='%(asctime)s-%(name)s-%(levelname)s-%(message)s'`**: This defines the structure of each line in your log file.\n",
    "* `%(asctime)s`: The timestamp of the log.\n",
    "* `%(name)s`: The name of the logger (defaults to `root`).\n",
    "* `%(levelname)s`: The \"importance\" level (DEBUG, INFO, etc.).\n",
    "* `%(message)s`: The actual text message you wrote.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`datefmt='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'`**: This tells Python how to format the date and time (Year-Month-Day Hour:Minute:Second).\n",
